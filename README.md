Title: History without a blind eye
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021
Review: This is the latest book by the author of the marvelous THE BOYS IN THE BOAT which is about the unlikely story of working-class rowers who upended the sport's elites to win the 1936 Olympic Gold metal right under Hitler's nose. Here Brown offers up a story featuring several, courageous working-class Japanese soldiers who were part of the 442nd and 522nd Army Battalion helped defeat Hitler‚Äôs troops. This they did despite anti-Japanese discrimination/racism/war hysteria and their families being locked up in American concentration camps (Brown makes it a point in his book to make sure the camps are called ‚Äúconcentration camps‚Äù). Like BOYS IN THE BOAT, the narrative of this book follows several families whom we meet on the brink of Pearl Harbor. They come from various locations with different family histories. Many are from Hawaii and the West Coast exclusion zone as well as Spokane, Washington. They too needed to learn to live together.
For me, the first half of the book was the most interesting as it covers the racism and unconstitutional rounding up the families; interning them without even a single consideration for law or the constitution. (Brown also follows one of the brave resisters who fought the internment in court and prison.) The second half of the book is a detailed account of Japanese American Troops training in Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and then fighting as segregated troops (in Italy and France) suffering horrific casualties. Especially fighting their way into the Voges Mountains to rescue the 211 survivors (out of 554) of the Texas Battalion, where the 442nd lost 121 dead and upwards to 800 wounded. K Company alone went into the rescue with 181 men and returned with only 8 unhurt. The 442nd is recognized as the most decorated battalion in WWII.
Today, many in our country think it best to whitewash the past and twist our history with nostalgia, using an airbrush. This is not one of those books. I would be surprised if most potential readers do not by now know the awful things that were done to Japanese Americans during the 2nd World War and after.

One example of national intolerance was that while training in Mississippi no local families welcomed Japanese American Troops into their homes, but they did invite Nazi German Prisoners of war that were imprisoned close by. And after the war ended many displaced Japanese families and VETs were banned from returning to their homes. So disgraceful! President Truman was so shocked by racist vigilantes that he wrote Eleanor Roosevelt, ‚ÄúThese disgraceful actions almost make you believe that a lot of our Americans have a streak of Nazi in them.‚Äù

Title: This is a must read.

Review: I live in Seattle my boys were in a Boy Scout troop. The Scoutmaster and many of the fathers were in the 442nd combat group. The Scout group was sponsored by the Japanese Baptist Church. We were not Japanese or Baptist. It was a great scout troop. Over many year of friendship with the adult leaders little bits and pieces of this story came out. As a student none of this story was ever taught. I made an amphibious assault in 1965 at Chu Lai. I was a dentist so had no direct combat experience but served in medical evacuation of wounded. What the 442nd faced and did never got them the credit they deserved. The families being held in "Camps" was never told. Loosing their homes, farms, etc was never told. This is a book we all should read. It was a good book. It told a story that needed to be told. It made me more honored to have know many of the men who served their country in the 442nd while their families were in camp. The fact that my children associated with the grandchildren of these fine people was a wonderful education for them. My family is white. My kids are adopted, my daughter is Asian but Filipino. She too was fully accepted into the Girl Scout program of this church.

Title: Wow,!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023
Review: This is a fantastic tale of what it was like to be a Japanese-American during World War II. It is written from multiple perspectives, from those relocated and imprisoned, those who were members of the military, and the chaplains who met the spiritual needs of the soldiers. The story is illuminating, heartbreaking, and inspiring. The author outlines the racism of the times in a very thoughtful manner and helped me to understand the parallels that exist in America today.

I thought I knew enough about the internment of Japanese-Americans and their battles in Italy and France. I was wrong. If you are interested in these topics, you will be pleased to read this book.

Review: This is not a book you will "like" - it is heartbreaking and sad and made me cry. But literally every book I have read by this author has left me inspired and intrigued. BUY AND READ everything you can find by him if you have ANY interest in history.

(I am not a "sports" person - I don't like following sports or reading about sports - but when a friend recommended, "The Boys in the Boat," I was hooked. I've since recommended it to every person I run into. Even my 87 year old mother was entranced.)

Title: Racism: American Heritage
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2022
Review: The history books, even the editions published for Midwestern public schools, do not adequately teach our Euro White racism towards people of color.

Sure, students learn marginal generalities about Native Americans and slavery, but they are not acquainted with the gory details. Nor are they required to read ancillary books which do reveal the vile history of White behaviors inflicted on ALL peoples of color at ALL times in this country‚Äôs racist past.

A book like Facing the Mountain should be required to introduce racism towards Asian
Americans. Others in the cannon detailing
factual treatment of specific races, including the contributions the people of those races have made to America and to the world, could easily be a textbook and a requirement for graduation from an American public school.

Perhaps our modern progressive society is ready to be transformed?

First, of course, Americans would have to return to funding public schools over funding private for profit and religious schools designed to Whitewash history.

Review: Loved becoming aware of the patriotism of Americans who were treated so badly by the FDR administration. As a Vietnam vet the details of the patriotism was amazing. I have so enjoyed visiting the DeRussy museum in Wakiki several times since returning from Vietnam in 1967 and it inspired me to read this book and others with great American stories.
